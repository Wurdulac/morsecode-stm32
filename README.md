It is a simple bare metal project for STM32F401RE. In this project a Microcontroller (STM32F401RE) is programmed to receive text messages from the serial interface and send them with morse code by using the built-in LED. Using serial interface (UART) to send messages through the serial interface. Using interupt-based character reception. Systick timer for adjusting morse code symbol timings.
